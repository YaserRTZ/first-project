# First-project
this is my first action for learning IT!

## Awareness of the way...!

### Hard working...!
> If you wanna get ***successfull*** in this way, you should go slowly and be ***hardwork***.

### Control your mind, Don't be a loser...!
> At the first experiense for learn it, you think that you've never can do this jobs that other people can...  
So when you got disapointed, that's the moment you should know you're gonna be a loser..Maybe for the other moments of your life,too!

### regular schedule...!
> And how..?!  
How do we can learn that more easilier?  
I think you've undestand it! ;)  
when you thisty to learn and be persistent, you are going to make a plan for that!  
that's plan can helpyou to improve yourself in that activity!  
but you should make a promis to do it regular :)  

**This is that i have learned so far from the three sessions of my teacher!  
Hope you liked it and it was useful.**
